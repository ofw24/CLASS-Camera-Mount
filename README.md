# CLASS-Camera-Mount
There are two files for each mount piece in this repository. The .stl files are generic filetypes that can be used in any slicer program. If you plan to use a Lulzbot printer, the .gcode files can be downloaded directly and sent to the printer without using a slicer.
The mount top redraft files are the top of the cradle, the base files are the base of the cradle, and the custom nut files are the nuts that keep longer screws snug to the junction box.
